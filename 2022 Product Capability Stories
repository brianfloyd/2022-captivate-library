# Product Capability Stories

As of 5/1/22 I have set out to rewrite SuperWrapper.  This wrapper was origninally written in 2020 and my coding abilities, and thought processes surrounding the approach have evolved.  The purpose of this document is to set up an Agile like system of development broken into 3 major components.

    - Rewrite of xAPI controller to be as conformant as possible to xAPI   
      profiles, and further allow customization, but not require it
    
    - Rewrite of Captivate functionality. This component includes creating   
      a completely independent 'class' of functions inside of the wrapper for Adobe Captivate.  The reasoning for this is to extend the controller to other tools in the future.  Moving forward the Captivate portion of the wrapper could be considered 'A plug-in' in the way it operates.   The xAPI controller should still be 100% functional even if the Captivate class is removed from the code. No dependecies!

    - Create a user UI to install warpper.  The current Captivate wrapper  
      requires the user to assign the LRS and customize the wrapper settings within the code.  It also requires setting up a file structure in a very particular way for uploaded zip package.  This is a barrier to entry for less tech saavy consumers

The long term vision for this project is to create an xAPI service that is fully customizable through a UI to add to a variety of e-learning publish outputs that has a robust 'free' offering for the community to use, and then a more advanced 'subscription' or per usage model that allows for mass production, and ultimate customizability.


### Controller Stories

As an xapi interface, when installed in a Captivate library I automatically install my components making it unnecessary for any special javascript in Captivate to make it work. (Current state is init() must be placed on slide 1)

As the developer, I need to identify all the actions in that are reportable in Adobe Captivate

As the developer, identify take identified actions and find conforming xAPI profile wherever possible.

As the developer, create an e-learning style presentation for each action.  In beginning development this will just be a raw action with little format and design but will become detailed as the capability is implemented with how to best utilize the functionality.

As the developer, update and design conformance for Scorm publish (LMS upload)

As the developer, update and design conformance for HTML publish

As the developer, update and design conformance for xAPI publish

As the developer, I will add a feature that allows for multiple LRS's at once to be communicated with. 
    AC: Create an Array of LRS credentials that are set up and authenticated allowing to send singular statemetns to multiple LRS's in concert.


# UI Stories

## Epic -

As an instructional designer, I have an avaiable UI interface that was created in Electron that allows me to drag and drop my Adobe publish package to install SuperWrapper

## Stories -

#UI -1 
As an ID, it collects my email and set up password and communciates with with server to capture user profile.
    AC: A launchable electron inteface for both Mac and PC installs that prompts for user name and password, communicates it back to a server and either creates a new user or validates existing user.  This functionality should have forgotten password functionality.

#UI-2
As an ID, I have customizable settings in the UI.  This list will grow as develpment continues but starting functinality will include capturing the LRS secret and password along with the LRS endpoint.  
    AC: An input box for LRS credentials (key, secret, password), once entered the a 'test' statement is sent to the LRS with accepted criteria being a HTTP 200 status.  The ID should be prompted if the credentials are not working correctly.

#UI-3
As an ID, once entering my LRS credentials I am able to name the LRS connection and save it to my profile if I desire.
    AC: User is presented a checkbox that when checked will save the entered LRS credentials and password to a secure server.

#UI-4
As an ID, on the settings screen I am able to see previous LRS connections that I have saved by name and it's endpoint.  Secret and Key will not be displayed or avaialble anywhere in the UI once stored.
    AC: Previously stored LRS's are listed and selectable for use. If no LRS has been saved #UI-3 will be the default behavior (prompting for LRS)

#UI-5 As an ID, a  gargabe can icon is presented to me along with ability to check multiple LRS's.  Clicking the garbage can will remove stored LRS after a confirmation modal is displayed.  Checking multiple LRS's will set up the code to report to multiple destinations.
    AC: User is able to remove previously stored LRS's with the garbage can icon.  Checking multiple LRS's will call the server and aquire the credentials for each for injection into the Captivate package code. Brian will rewrite the wrapper to account for multiple LRS's in Array
